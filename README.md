# Simple UART for FPGA

Simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver & Transmitter) module for serial communication with an FPGA. The UART module was implemented using VHDL.

The UART module passed simulations. In the near future it will be implemented generic support for parity bit and set the number of stop bits. Stay tuned!

#####Synthesis resource usage summary:
- Logic element (LUT): 85
- Registers (FF): 50

*Synthesis was performed using Quartus II 64-Bit Version 13.0.1 with default values of generics.*
